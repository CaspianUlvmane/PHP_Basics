<p>Psychonauts follows Razputin, 
    a young boy gifted with psychic 
    abilities who runs away from the 
    circus to try to sneak into a 
    psychic summer camp. His goal 
    is to become a Psychonaut, a 
    secret government spy with psychic 
    abilities. He finds that there is 
    a sinister plot occurring at the 
    camp that only he can stop. The 
    game is centered on exploring the 
    strange and imaginative minds 
    of various characters that Raz 
    encounters as a Psychonaut-in-training/"Psycadet" 
    to help them overcome their fears 
    or memories of their past, so as 
    to gain their help and progress in the game. </p>
